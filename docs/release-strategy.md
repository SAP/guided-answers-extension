This section details the process the team follow to release


The  team have two week Sprints followed by one week of testing/stabilization before it is release to the VSCode Market Place. 
As we overlap the Stabilization Phase with the next Sprint we are releasing new functionality, updates & fixes every two weeks. 

This means that from start of development until the code is delivered is 3 weeks.
