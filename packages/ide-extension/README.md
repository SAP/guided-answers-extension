# Guided Answers extension by SAP

[SAPâ€™s Guided Answers](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html) is an interactive documentation designed to help troubleshoot issues, navigate processes, and guide users through tasks via a series of questions. SAP experts document the exact steps for analyzing issues and make that available to the customers. SAP's Guided Answers is recommended to customers to get the most from the support. Customers can look for solutions themselves instead of opening a customer support incident.
 
This Guided Answers extension by SAP renders content of already existing Guided Answers directly in an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) such as SAP Business Application Studio (SBAS) and Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode), making the content interactive and context-aware within the IDE. Developers do not need to navigate back and forth between separate supporting materials and their IDE when they come across an issue. This extension improves and speeds up the support process for SAP tools and increases user satisfaction. It will also help support teams provide clearer and more accurate solutions to issues to their customers. 
## Usage 
To launch Guided Answer Extension within VSCode or SBAS
```
1. Use Command Palette -> CMD/CTRL + Shift + P
2. Type command -> SAP: Open Guided Answers
```
